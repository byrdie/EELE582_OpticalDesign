3. EFL = 199.987mm
   BFD = 49.991mm
   f/# = 15

4. EFL = 121.031mm
   BFD = 47.365mm
   t = 40.000mm
   Total track = 92.365mm
   rms spot sizes = 64.022um, 81.732um, 95.310um
   These spot sizes do not meet our design goal.
   From the OPD plot, the dominant aberration appears to be coma
   W040 = 2.288 waves
   W131 = -2.318 waves
   W222 = 1.693 waves
   The ray fans and spots show features resembling coma	

5. The front lens changed to a plano-convex lens, and the back lens has formed into a negative meniscus.
   EFL = 119.974
   BFD = 50.038
   t = 40.000
   rms spot sizes = 17.297, 28.166, 38.702
   these spot sizes do not meet our design goal
   astigmatism is the dominant aberration.
   This is different from before because we did not optimize to reduce astigmatism.
   W040 = 0.619
   W131 = -0.254
   W222 = 1.156
   The ray fans exhibited a lot of astigmatism and spherical aberration.

6. Used the compensator solver to maintain distance of 40mm between lens elements. Used MXCA and MNCA
   operands to control thickness of back of second lens surface, Was not very successful. Stop is inside the back 
   lens.
   EFL = 119.88
   BFD = 50.201
   t = 40.000
   rms spot sizes = 25.400, 21.616, 57.199
   Coma is most dominant. With the most obvious example being in the off axis rays.
   W040 = -0.864
   W131 = -1.080
   W222 = 3.588
   This solution isn't practical since the stop is inside the lens.
   The rays fans show significant signs of spherical, coma and astigmatism

7. Used the default merit function to inser TRAC operands. RMS radius now within specifications after optimization.
   Stop now inside the front lens.
   EFL = 119.996
   BFL = 50.005
   t = 40.000
   rms spot sizes = 5.036, 14.334, 19.176
   these spot sizes do meet our design goal
   coma is dominant
   W040 = 0.192
   W131 = -1.655
   W222 = 0.067
   This solution is nearly practical. The stop is technically inside the lens, but could be moved out a small
   amount to accomadate a physical stop.
   The spot diagrams show coma and astigmatism.

8. Moved stop to in front of first lens. made thickness of back of first lens 40mm and added MXCA and MNCA 
   operands to keep the thickness between 10-60mm. After optimization, thikcness has increased to the max value.
   Spot sizes descreased.
   EFL = 119.999
   BFD = 50.001
   t = 60.000
   rms spot sizes = 4.298 7.188 9.410
   These spot sizes do meet our design goal.
   Coma is the dominant aberration coefficient
   W040 = 0.166
   W131 = -0.651
   W222 = -0.089

9. We set the weight to zero on the DIFF operand to lift the restriction on the back focal length. As a result, the
   BFD increased and the distance between the lenses decreased. The on-axis spot size got slightly larger, but the 
   off-axis spot sizes are smaller by a few um
   EFL = 120.000
   BFD = 78.576
   t = 28.668
   total track = 112.243
   rms spot sizes = 5.045, 5.741, 7.260
   These spot sizes do indeed meet our design goal.
   Coma is the dominant Siedel aberratio, but only slightly.
   W040 = 0.191
   W131 = 0.205
   W222 = 0.154
   This solution is practical. The lenses are reasonable, and not too thin. The total track is still less than the EFL,
   but only barely.
   
10. First, I tried using the ISFN operand to minimize the f/#, but I could not understand how to make the 
    clear semi-diameter of the stop a variable. So to do this I simply decremented the image space f number in the 
    Aperature section of the system data editor by one and then optimized. Through this method, I was able to
    reduce the f/# to f/6.5 while maintaining an off-axis spot size of less than 20um.
    EFL = 119.999
    BFD = 72.694
    t = 36.399
    total track = 114.093
    rms spot sizes = 13.782, 15.179, 18.826
    These spot sizes barely meet out criteria.
    Spherical aberration is the dominant Siedel aberration
    W040 = 0.727
    W131 = 0.585
    W222 = 0.702
    This solution meets all of our design goals, and is about 30% faster than the initial design.
